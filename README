                       =============================
                       EVE-Online mineral calculator
                       =============================

This is an application developed to help me and all the other miners out there
in EVE with income prediction.
Picture a fleet of a couple of Hulks, Covetors and Retrievers; all of them
mining Arkonor. How much ISK will they make in two hours?.
A simpler (but equally important) question would be "How much is this pile of
minerals worth if I sell it to the corporation (fixed prices)?"

My intention is to have this application answer this kind of questions.

                               --------------
Currently there is only one way to enter the information needed, which is
by following the step by step input interface. Alternate input methods would be
a useful improvement.
The current version of the master branch can use both ores and minerals as a
basis for calculations.
