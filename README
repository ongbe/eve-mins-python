                       EVE-Online mineral calculator
                       =============================

This is an application developed to help me and all the other miners out there
in EVE with income prediction.
Picture a fleet of a couple of Hulks, Covetors and Retrievers; all of them
mining Arkonor. How much ISK will they make in two hours?.
A simpler (but equally important) question would be "How much is this pile of
minerals worth if I sell it to the corporation (fixed prices)?"

My intention is to have this application answer these questions.

                              --------------
Currently the master-branch is capable of reading a list of predefined mineral
prices and convert a user input amount of minerals to ISK.

The ores-branch does not yet handle ore input.
The data describing the mineral correspondance of each ore is loaded from an
external file. The current issue is that I plan on moving the concept of amounts
out of the Item constructors and I don't know what the best way would be to do
that.
