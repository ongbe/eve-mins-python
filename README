                       =============================
                       EVE-Online mineral calculator
                       =============================

This is an application developed to help me and all the other miners out there
in EVE with income prediction.
Picture a fleet of a couple of Hulks, Covetors and Retrievers; all of them
mining Arkonor. How much ISK will they make in two hours?.
A simpler (but equally important) question would be "How much is this pile of
minerals worth if I sell it to the corporation (fixed prices)?"

My intention is to have this application answer this kind of questions.

                               --------------
Currently the application accepts values both through interactive input
and by parsing an input file.
Next step is to implement a GUI, probably with wxwidgets.
